## Why Abalone?

Abalone is a highly sought-after seafood globally, contributing significantly to the economy. Many individuals and nations depend on it for simple food and economic stability. Therefore, studying abalone populations is crucial. However, determining the age of abalone is a very time consuming and tedious process. It involves slicing the shell, staining it, and counting the rings under a microscope. Other measurements that are simpler to acquire can be used for age estimation. That is what our goal is for this project.

## Our Data

The goal of this data source and project is to predict the age of the abalone from physical measurements.
The data has been scaled by dividing continuous values of variables such as length, diameter, height and shell weight by 200. 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height=5}
abalone <- read.csv("abalone.data", header = FALSE)
column_names <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole_weight", 
                  "Shucked_weight", "Viscera_weight", "Shell_weight", "Rings")
colnames(abalone) <- column_names
abalone <- cbind(abalone, model.matrix(~ Sex - 1, data = abalone))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height=5}
abalone$Sex <- factor(abalone$Sex)
glimpse(abalone)
```

# Scatter plot for Diameter vs. Rings
g2 <- ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Diameter, y = Rings)) +

## Exploratory: Heatmap / Correlatio Matrix
```{r fig.height=5}

```
